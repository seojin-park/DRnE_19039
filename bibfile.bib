abstract = {The Case 2 chlorophyll a algorithm is based on a semi-analytical, bio-optical model of remotesensing reflectance, Rrs($\lambda$), where Rrs($\lambda$) is defined as the water-leaving radiance, Lw($\lambda$), divided by the downwelling irradiance just above the sea surface, Ed($\lambda$,0+ ). The Rrs($\lambda$) model (Section 3) has two free variables, the absorption coefficient due to phytoplankton at 675 nm, a$\phi$(675), and the absorption coefficient due to colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) or gelbstoff at 400 nm, ag(400). The Rrs model has several parameters that are fixed or can be specified based on the region and season of the MODIS scene. These control the spectral shapes of the optical constituents of the model. Rrs($\lambda$i) values from the MODIS data processing system are placed into the model, the model is inverted, and a$\phi$(675), ag(400) (MOD24), and chlorophyll a (MOD21, Chlor{\_}a{\_}3) are computed. The algorithm also outputs both the total absorption coefficients, a($\lambda$i) (MOD36), and permits calculation of the phytoplankton absorption coefficients, a$\phi$($\lambda$i) (MOD36), based on a$\phi$(675) retrievals. These are used in the calculation of the absorbed radiation by phytoplankton (MOD22) for use in the calculation of chlorophyll fluorescence efficiencies (MOD20). MOD22 is also dependent upon the instantaneous photosynthetically available radiation (MOD22), which is discussed in ATBD20. Algorithm development is initially focused on tropical, subtropical, and summer temperate environments, and the model is parameterized in Section 4 for three different bio-optical domains: (1) high ratios of photoprotective pigments to chlorophyll and low self-shading, which for brevity, we designate as Aunpackaged@; (2) low ratios and high self-shading, which we designate as Apackaged@; and (3) a transitional or global-average type. These domains can be identified from space by comparing seasurface temperature to nitrogen-depletion temperatures for each domain (Section 5). Algorithm errors of more than 45{\%} are reduced to errors of less than 30{\%} with this approach, with the greatest effect occurring at the eastern and polar boundaries of the basins [Carder et al., 1999]. Section 6 provides an expansion of bio-optical domains into high-latitude waters. The “fully packaged” pigment domain is introduced in this section along with a revised strategy for implementing these variable packaging domains. Algorithm errors are reduced from 41{\%} for an empirical algorithm to 20{\%} using the semianalytical approach for global MODIS data in Section 7 [Carder et al., 2003].},

abstract = {A regional algorithm to estimate SST fields in the western North Pacific, where small oceanographic disturbance are often found, has been developed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) aboard Terra and Aqua. Its associated algorithm, which includes cloud screening and SST estimation, is based on an algorithm for the Global Imager (GLI) aboard Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) and is tuned for MODIS sensors. For atmospheric correction, we compare Multi-Channel SST (MCSST), Nonlinear SST (NLSST), Water Vapor SST (WVSST) and Quadratic SST (QDSST) techniques. For NLSST, four first-guess SSTs are investigated, including the values for MCSST, climatology with two different spatial resolutions, and near-real-time objective analysis. The results show that the NLSST method using high-resolution climatological SST as a first-guess has both good quality and high efficiency. The differences of root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the NLSST models using low-resolution climatology and those using high-resolution climatology are up to 0.25 K. RMSEs of the new algorithm are 0.70 K/0.65 K for daytime (Aqua/Terra) and 0.65 K/0.66 K for nighttime, respectively. Diurnal warming and the stratification of the ocean surface layer under low wind are discussed. {\textcopyright} The Oceanographic Society of Japan/TERRAPUB/Springer 2007.},

We modelled at the knowledge level the reasoning process of a search mission coordinator when conducting a diagnosis task to determine the routes likely followed by an aircraft missing overland. Knowledge engineering allowed us to develop a reasoning model based on documents and on interviews with domain experts. Our study was conducted in the CommonKADS knowledge modelling framework. The proposed model was validated by domain experts and implemented in a rule-based prototype. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 ASAC. Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Sobrino2003,
abstract = {This paper gives operational algorithms for retrieving sea (SST), land surface temperature (LST) and total atmospheric water vapour content (W) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To this end, the MODTRAN 3.5 radiative transfer program was used to predict radiances for MODIS channels 31, 32, 2, 17, 18 and 19. To analyse atmospheric effects, a simulation with a set of radiosonde observations was used to cover the variability of surface temperature and water vapour concentration on a worldwide scale. These simulated data were split into two sets (DB1 and DB2), the first one (DB1) was used to fit the coefficients of the algorithms, while the second one (DB2) was used to test the fitted coefficients. The results show that the algorithms are capable of producing SST and LST with a standard deviation of 0.3 K and 0.7 K if the satellite data are error free. The LST product has been validated with in situ data from a field campaign carried out in the Mississippi (USA), the results show for the LST algorithm proposed a root mean square error lower than 0.5 K. Regarding water vapour content, a ratio technique is proposed, which is capable of estimating W from the absorbing channels at 0.905, 0.936, and 0.94 $\mu$m, and the atmospheric window channel at 0.865 $\mu$m, with a standard deviation (in the comparison with radiosonde observations) of 0.4 gcm-2.},
